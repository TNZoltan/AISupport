      "Answer": ["The majority of the IKEA furniture range is available at Shop Online along with an increasing selection of our home accessories range. We are planning to increase the ranges available in future. We show as many items as possible online as you may wish to visit one of our stores for the item, and it will enable you to have the product details to hand before you visit. Items available to purchase online display the \"available to buy online\" option."]
