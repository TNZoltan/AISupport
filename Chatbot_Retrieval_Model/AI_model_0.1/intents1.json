You will automatically be referred to your card issuer's website to register during the checkout process. If you encounter problems with registration, please contact your card issuing bank directly. \\n\\n Once you have registered, whenever you shop online with any retailer that shows the 'Verified by Visa' and 'Mastercard SecureCode' logos, you will have one more step in the shopping process. You will be taken to their debit/credit card issuers' website to enter your password before you are returned to the checkout to complete the purchase.
